<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project serves as a comprehensive testing framework that leverages Cucumber BDD, TestNG, and Selenium for robust UI testing. It is designed to provide an efficient and scalable solution for automated testing with a focus on maintainability and ease of use.

Key Features
- Cucumber BDD: Facilitates behavior-driven development by defining test scenarios in natural language, which helps in bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- TestNG: A powerful testing framework that provides advanced functionalities like test configuration, parallel execution, and detailed reporting.
- Selenium WebDriver: Enables browser automation for end-to-end testing of web applications, ensuring comprehensive test coverage across various browsers and platforms.
  
Core Components
- Cucumber Features and Step Definitions:
  The framework includes a set of Cucumber feature files that outline test scenarios in Gherkin language. Each scenario is linked to corresponding step definitions that implement the test logic.
  
- Driver Utility with Singleton Design Pattern:
  Implements a singleton design pattern to manage the Selenium WebDriver instance, ensuring that only one instance of the driver is created and reused throughout the test suite.
  
- Configuration Properties with Configuration Reader:
  Configuration properties are centrally managed, and a configuration reader is provided to access these properties. This approach allows for easy modification and management of configuration settings without altering the codebase.
  
- Utility Methods with Selenium WebDriver:
  The framework includes a set of utility methods for common Selenium WebDriver operations, such as element interaction and browser navigation, to streamline test development and reduce code duplication.
  
- Page Object Model (POM) Concepts:
  Adopts the Page Object Model pattern, which encapsulates page elements and actions within page classes. This approach promotes a more centralized and maintainable structure, facilitating easier updates and enhancements to the test scripts.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

By focusing on these core concepts, the project aims to provide a clear and practical example of how Spring can be used to build a robust and scalable service. It serves as a valuable learning resource for understanding the essential principles of the Spring framework and their application in real-world scenarios.
